# About Us 
The uOttawa Computational Nanophotonics Lab is led by Lora Ramunno, who is a Full Professor in the [Department of Physics](https://science.uottawa.ca/physics/) and a member of the [Nexus for Quantum Technologies Institute (NEXQT) at uOttawa](https://www2.uottawa.ca/research-innovation/quantum-institute). We explore the fundamental physics and applications in nanophotonics, nonlinear optics, imaging, extreme light-matter interactions, and artificial intelligence.

We have many active collaborations with leading experimental and theoretical scientists in Canada and Internationally, including the [Max Planck - uOttawa Center for Extreme and Quantum Photonics](https://research.uottawa.ca/centres-institutes/max-planck-centre).
