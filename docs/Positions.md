# Positions

The Computational Nanophotonics Lab at the University of Ottawa’s Nexus for Quantum Technologies Institute (NEXQT) offers exciting opportunities to conduct collaborative, interdisciplinary research with such world renowned groups as the Max-Planck uOttawa Centre for Extreme and Quantum Photonics, Canada’s National Research Council (NRC), the uOttawa-NRC Joint Centre for Extreme Photonics (JCEP), and various industrial partners. The lab also benefits from access to Canada’s largest, state-of-the-art, supercomputers

## Postdoctoral Fellowship - Quantum Microscopy

We are seeking two exceptional candidates for Postdoctoral Fellowship positions in experimental and theoretical Quantum Microscopy. The experimental project is in the development of quantum light sources for nonlinear optical microscopy and the theoretical project involves analytical and computational modeling in quantum nonlinear microscopy. 

For more information, please see full job posting [here](https://mysite.science.uottawa.ca/lramunno/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/Quantum_Mining_2_Postdocs_Ad-002.pdf). 

## Graduate Student Position - Quantum Microscopy

We are seeking an exceptional candidate for a graduate student position in theoretical Quantum Microscopy. This project involves analytical and computational modeling in quantum nonlinear microscopy, interested candidates should contact Dr. Lora Ramunno: [lora.ramunno@uottawa.ca](lora.ramunno@uottawa.ca)

## Postdoctoral Fellowship - HHG in Nanostructured Solids

We are seeking an exceptional candidate for a Postdoctoral Fellowship position in theoretical and computational photonics. Working with a team of top researchers in ultra-fast/attosecond science and nanophotonics, the successful candidate will construct theoretical models and employ large scale simulations, with the goal of expanding scientific understanding of high harmonic generation (HHG) in nanostructured solids. They will also apply such understanding to the design of nanostructured materials for novel HHG technologies. The research is ground breaking and has far reaching implications for applications such as semiconductor technology, photo electron spectroscopy, high intensity VUV and EUV sources and nanoscale imaging.

# About uOttawa

The University of Ottawa is located near downtown Ottawa, the picturesque, vibrant and multicultural capital city of Canada.

The University of Ottawa is home to the [Nexus for Quantum Technologies Institute (NEXQT)](https://www2.uottawa.ca/research-innovation/quantum-institute), an interdisciplinary centre with world renowned photonic research from nanophotonics to attosecond science to quantum information. There are 57 associated faculty members across 4 faculties, many of whom hold prestigious research chairs, including a Canada Excellence Research Chair, and have been awarded many honours and prizes.

The NEXQT boasts state-of-the-art laboratories in the new Advanced Research Complex, including the NanoFab core facility, and major international partnerships, such as the [Max-Planck uOttawa Centre for Extreme and Quantum Photonics](http://www.mpc-eqp.ca).

Ottawa also has a strong concentration of photonics and technology companies and national laboratories, with whom we have established many partnerships. This includes the [Joint Centre for Extreme Photonics (JCEP)](http://extremephotonics.com), which was recently established to foster high impact collaborative research between the National Research Council of Canada and the University of Ottawa.

Interested students and recent graduates are encouraged to apply for positions at the undergraduate, graduate, and postdoc levels.

We are committed to fostering diversity as a source of excellence and strength. We welcome applications from those who would contribute further to diversity, including (but not limited to): women,  First Nations, Inuit and Métis peoples, persons with disabilities, members of visible minorities and persons of any sexual orientation, gender identity  and/or expression.
